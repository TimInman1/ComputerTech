1. I have actually not had much experience with computer hardward in my life. I used to be a big PC gamer, but I never really delved into it until deciding to change my degree.

2. I'm mostly associated with Windows computers. I have had the same gaming computer since I was a little kid which still works great!

3. I have used the basics when it comes to software. School has allowed me to learn how to make a spreadsheet and use Powerpoint - I'm excited to learn about the rest throughout my degree as well.

4. Also a no to programming and creating websites. Sounds really cool to be able to do though.

5. Personally it's a mixture between streaming apps and social media. I am a regular Prime user for television, so I'll do that every once in awhile. Other than that it is checking my phone for Facebook/X whenever I get a chance.
